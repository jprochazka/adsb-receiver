## The Flight Tracking Community

I would like to thank the members and contributors to the following forums for all the time and effort
they have put in in order to create useful and informative places to discuss aircraft tracking.

* The FlightAware Forums:     https://discussions.flightaware.com
* The PlaneFinder Forums:     https://forum.planefinder.net
* The ADS-B Exchange Forums:  https://adsbx.discourse.group

The performance graphs were created thanks in part to the great contributions made by members of both
the FlightAware and PlaneFinder communities. Through their examples and help posted to the following
threads myself along with other contributors to the cause were able to add these informative graphs.
