I would like to thank the members and contributors to the following forums for all the time and effort
they have put in in order to create a useful and informative place to discuss aircraft tracking.

The performance graphs were created thanks in part to the great contributions made by members of both
the FlightAware and PlaneFinder communities. Through their examples and help posted to the following
threads I was able to add these very informative graphs.
